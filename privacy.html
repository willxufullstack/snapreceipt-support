    <h1>Privacy Policy - SnapReceipt</h1>

    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: August 21, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use SnapReceipt (the “Service”), and describes your choices and rights.</p>

        <li>Receipt images that you upload for analysis</li>
        <li>Structured results extracted from those images (e.g., store name, date, items, amounts, taxes, categories, summaries)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notifications and Devices</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Push notification device token (used only to send you in‑app notifications about analysis status and related service updates)</li>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide and maintain the Service: scan, analyze, and present receipt results</li>
        <li>Account management and authentication</li>
        <li>Send you service notifications (e.g., analysis status)</li>
        <li>Customer support and service quality</li>
        <li>Security, fraud prevention, and abuse prevention within reasonable scope</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>No third‑party advertising or marketing.</strong> We do not sell your personal information, and we do not use your information for third‑party advertising or marketing. We do not send marketing emails or marketing push notifications.</p>

    <h2>3. Third‑Party Services and Sharing</h2>
    <p>We share information with service providers only as needed to operate the Service:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cloud platform:</strong> Firebase/Google Cloud (authentication, database, storage, cloud functions)</li>
        <li><strong>AI analysis providers:</strong> Third‑party AI services (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini) used to analyze receipt images and return structured results</li>
        <li><strong>Sign‑in providers:</strong> Apple/Google Sign-In for authentication</li>
        <li><strong>Legal and safety:</strong> We may disclose information to comply with law or protect rights, safety, or property</li>

    <p>We do <em>not</em> share your information with third parties for their marketing purposes.</p>

    <h2>4. Analytics and Crash Reporting</h2>
    <p>We do not currently integrate analytics or crash reporting SDKs such as Firebase Analytics or Crashlytics. If this changes in the future, we will update this policy before enabling such collection.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Receipt history (free users):</strong> We typically retain receipt images and extracted results for up to 12 months, unless a longer retention is required by law. You may request deletion earlier via the in‑app account deletion feature.</li>
        <li><strong>Account information:</strong> Retained while your account is active and for a limited period after deletion where required for legal, security, or operational reasons.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. International Data Transfers</h2>

        <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> You can enable/disable notifications in your device settings at any time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Service is not intended for children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child provided us with personal data, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>

    <h2>9. Security</h2>
    <p>We employ reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. We will post updates on this page and adjust the “Last updated” date. For material changes, we will provide additional notice where appropriate.</p>
